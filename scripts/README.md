datacleaning_residentialtaxassessor.R is used to take tax assessor data, clean it, and and assign each relevant parcel to a home category.

statisticalanalysis_arcgisexport.R is created by merging the data assessor data with a parcel shapefile and the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool shapefile, then exporting from ArcGIS. It is used to run chi-square tests and create two-way tables for misc. points of the study.

Both were written in R 4.4.1
